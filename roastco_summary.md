# RoastCo â€“ Coffee Category Insights

## ðŸ“˜ Business Context

As part of RoastCoâ€™s Category Development team, this project analysed three years of retail POS data to understand brand, pricing, and promo performance in the Canadian coffee category.

## Key Business Questions

- Which brands are driving sales volume and revenue?
- How does promotion type impact performance?
- Are there clusters of retailer behaviour that support differentiated strategies?
- Whatâ€™s the relationship between price and units sold?

## Methods

- Grouped analysis by brand, promo, and region
- Clustered retailers using K-Means on brand sales mix
- Modelled units sold using price + encoded features (regression)

## Key Insights

- RoastCo Organic leads volume, especially in BC and ON
- Endcap and BOGO promos generate higher per-unit revenue
- Elasticity varies by brand: Original and Bold are more price-sensitive
- Clustered retailers showed 3 distinct volume and promo usage profiles

## Recommended Actions

- Rebalance shelf pricing for price-sensitive SKUs
- Tailor promo depth and messaging by retailer cluster
